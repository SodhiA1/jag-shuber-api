# Sheriff Scheduling API
This project represents the API for the Sheriff Scheduling (Shuber) application.

### [Project Architecture Documentation](./docs/index)

> TODO: NEED TO UPDATE THESE DOCS.  TALK TO COLTER FOR NOW.

## Commands 

The scripts can be organized into a few categories:

### Development
>`yarn watch:dev` 
>
> Launches the backend in dev mode against the development database.  Running this command will read and use environment variables defined in `.env.dev`.  See the ##Setup## section for instructions on how to have this file generated for you automatically. 

>`yarn build:clean`
>
> Cleans all compiled files (found in the `dist/`) with the exception of the `dist/.gitignore` folder. Then regenerates all typescript files and rebuilds.  **This should be done before issuing / completing Pull Requests**

### Testing

>### DO NOT RUN TESTS AGAINST ANY DATABASE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT
>
> The Tests have *setup* and *teardown* hooks that clear many of the database tables so that CRUD functionality of the API can be verified (i.e. numbers of records etc.)  

Generally, I run the following two commands in separate terminal windows so that I can clearly watch the output of both.

> `yarn watch:testing` 
>
> Launches the backend in dev mode against the testing database.  Running this command will read and use environment variables defined in `.env.testing`.  See the ##Setup## section for instructions on how to have this file generated for you automatically. 

>`yarn test`
>
> runs the jest tests for the application (should be done in conjuction with the `yarn watch:testing` command described above)

>`yarn test:coverage`
>
> Runs the jest tests for the API Client using code coverage and displays the coverage results in a browser.  Note that the coverage only covers the API Client code and not the API itself.

### Support
These commands typically don't have to be run and are here to support the commands described above.

>`yarn start`
>
> Starts the production instance of the API Server.  This generally not run on dev machines but instead is used by the openshift container running the application.

>`yarn start:dev`
>
> Starts the server loading the `.env.dev` environment variables, effectively wiring up to your development database.

>`yarn start:testing`
>
> Starts the server loading the `.env.testing` environment varibles, effectively wiring up to your testing database.

> `yarn build`
>
> Runs typescript to compile the javascript that ends up in `dist/`

> `yarn build:watch`
>
> Watches for changes to typescript files and runs the `build` command described above

>`yarn generate`
>
> Uses [TSOA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsoa) to generate the [`swagger.json`](dist/swagger.json) and the [`src/routes.ts`](src/routes.ts) based on the [Routes Template](templates/routeTemplate.handlebars) and the Controllers that are imported within the [Controller Index](src/controllers/index.ts) according to the [TSOA Config File](tsoa.json).
> 
> The generated `swagger.json` is then used by [swagger-ts-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ts-client) in conjuction with the [Type Definition Template](templates/typeDefinitions.handlebars) and the [Operation Group Template](templates/operationGroup.handlebars) to generate the [Model Definitions](src/client/models.ts) and the [Base Api Client](src/client/Client.ts).

>`yarn oc:dev`
>
> A development hook to allow debugging within the OpenShift environment.  This is typically never used and is largely untested but remains as a reminder of the possibility.
