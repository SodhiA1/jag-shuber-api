## Dependency Injection

In order to more cleanly facilitate per-request context and resources such as the current user, this project uses dependency injection and an IOC container that is created on a per-request basis.  

This project is using [typescript-ioc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-ioc).  Refer to their docs for more information.
